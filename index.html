            <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
            <p>
                Hi there! I am Alexander Shemaly, a passionate Computing student at Imperial College London,
                currently at my <b>third year</b> of study. I have a strong interest in artificial intelligence, 
                software engineering, and algorithm design. Over the years, I have developed a solid foundation 
                in creating immersive games, designing AI-driven applications, and enhancing user experiences, 
                which I am excited to continue building upon as I seek new challenges and opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
                On this site, you will find a showcase of my projects, a detailed overview of my skills, and a bit more
                about my journey in the world of computing. I am actively looking for a work placement to apply my knowledge
                in a real-world setting, collaborate with experienced professionals, and contribute to impactful projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Feel free to explore my work, learn more about me, and don not hesitate to get in touch if you'd like to
                discuss any potential opportunities!
            </p>

                STARGLIDE is a space-themed endless runner where players control a spaceship to
                navigate through a constantly shifting path. The game becomes progressively
                harder as the speed increases, challenging your ability to stay on course.
                The objective is to stay on the path for as long as possible to achieve the
                highest score.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Game written in C++ using the RayLib framework and devkitPro toolchain.</i>
            </p>

            <p>
                STARGLIDE is a game written for the Nintendo 3DS, but I also wanted it to have
                a port for PC. During its creation, I developed a framework called
                <a href="https://github.com/AlexShem247/desktop-3ds-game-framework">
                    Cross-Platform Game Framework for Desktop and Nintendo 3DS
                </a>
                , which unifies software
                development for these two platforms and makes it easier to write code without having any previous
                experience for developing 3DS applications.
            </p>

            <p>
                I was inspired by a course at university called <i>Software Engineering Design</i>, which teaches about
                software design patterns and principles. This course emphasised the importance of creating adaptable
                and scalable architectures, which motivated me to design a framework that makes software developement easier.

                My Maze Raycasting Game is a maze exploration game where players navigate through
                <b>randomly generated</b> mazes, collect all coins, and avoid zombies to progress
                through increasingly difficult levels. The game leverages on
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting">Ray Casting</a>
                , a technique using in early video games to efficiently render a 3D world from a 2D
                playing field, and a modified
                <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm">Depth-First Search (DFS) Maze Generation Algorithm</a>
                , offering an immersive gameplay experience.

            <p>
                <i>Game written in Java using the libGDX library.</i>
            </p>

            <p>
                My fascination with 2.5D graphics and the complex mathematics behind them inspired me to create this game.
                I have always been intrigued by how simple 2D elements can be transformed into immersive 3D-like environments
                through techniques like ray casting. Additionally, I wanted to apply and deepen my understanding of algorithms
                and mathematical concepts that I had previously studied.
